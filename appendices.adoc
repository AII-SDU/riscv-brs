=== Firmware Implementation Guidance

The guidance section is non-normative, and covers certain
implementation choices, suggestions, historical context, etc.

==== ACPI Implementation Guidance

Certain implementations may make use of the RISC-V Functional Fixed hardware Specification cite:[FFH].

===== FADT

cite:[ACPI] (Section 5.2.9) provides guidance on filling the
Fixed ACPI Description Table for HW-reduced ACPI.

Don't forget to select an appropriate Preferred PM Profile.
