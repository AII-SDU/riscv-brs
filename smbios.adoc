== SMBIOS Requirements

The System Management BIOS (SMBIOS) specification defines a standard format for presenting management information about an implentation, mostly focusing on hardware components.

This section defines the BRS-I mandatory and optional SMBIOS requirements
on top of cite:[SMBIOS], and is optional and recommended for BRS-B. Additional non-normative guidance may be found in the <<smbios-guidance, appendix>>.

=== Type 44 Processor-Specific Data

The following fields are defined to follow the standard processor-specific block fields (cite:[SMBIOS], Section 7.45.1).

The structure is defined in a manner consistent with the DMTF specification
language (cite:[SMBIOS]), and is valid for processors of architecture 07h (RV64) only.

The structure begins with a version field to allow for future extensibility in a backwards-compatible
manner. The version field is to be incremented any time fields are added. The current version of the structure is 000Ah (v0.10).

| Offset | Version | Name      | Length | Value   | Description
| 00h|000Ah|Revision of RISC-V Processor-specific Block Structure|WORD|Varies|Bit 15:8 Major revision +
Bit 7:0 Minor revision +
The newer revision of RISC-V Processor-specific Block
Structure is backward compatible with older version of this structure.
| 02h| 000Ah| Hart ID| QWORD| Varies| The ID of this RISC-V Hart
| 0Ah| 000Ah| Boot Hart| BYTE| Boolean| 1: This is boot hart to boot system +
0: This is not the boot hart
| 0Bh| 000Ah| Machine Vendor ID | QWORD| Varies| The vendor ID of this
RISC-V Hart
| 13h| 000Ah| Machine Architecture ID| QWORD| Varies| Base
microarchitecture of the hart. Value of 0 is possible to indicate the field is
not implemented. The combination of Machine Architecture ID and Machine Vendor
ID should uniquely identify the type of hart microarchitecture that is implemented.
| 1Bh| 000Ah| Machine Implementation ID| QWORD| Varies| Unique encoding
of the version of the processor implementation. Value of 0 is possible to indicate
the field is not implemented. The Implementation value should reflect the design of
the RISC-V Hart.
| 23h| 000Ah| Instruction set supported| DWORD| Bit-field | Bits [25:0]
encodes the presence of RISC-V standard extensions, which is equivalent to bits
[25:0] in RISC-V Machine ISA Register (**misa** CSR). Bits set to one mean the
certain extensions of instruction set are supported on this hart.
| 27h| 000Ah| Privilege Level Supported| BYTE| Varies| The privilege levels
supported by this RISC-V Hart. +
Bit 0 Machine Mode +
BIT 1 Reserved +
BIT 2 Supervisor Mode +
Bit 3 User Mode +
BIT 6:4 Reserved +
BIT 7 Debug Mode
| 28h| 000Ah| Machine Exception Trap Delegation Information| QWORD| Varies|
Bit set to one means the corresponding exception is delegated to supervisor execution
environment. Otherwise, supervisor execution environment must register the event
handler in Machine-Mode for the certain exceptions through environment call.
| 30h| 000Ah| Machine Interrupt Trap Delegation Information| QWORD| Varies|
Bit set to one means the corresponding interrupt is delegated to supervisor execution
environment. Otherwise, supervisor execution environment must register the event
handler in Machine-Mode for the certain interrupts through environment.
| 38h| 000Ah| The register width (XLEN)| BYTE| ENUM| The width of register
supported by this RISC-V Hart
| 39h| 000Ah| Machine Mode native base integer ISA width (M-XLEN)| BYTE| ENUM|
The width (See below) of Machine Mode native base integer ISA supported by this RISC-V
Hart
| 3Ah| 000Ah| Reserved| BYTE| ENUM| Placeholder for Hypervisor Mode
| 3Bh| 000Ah| Supervisor Mode native base integer ISA width (S-XLEN)| BYTE| ENUM|
The width (See below) of Supervisor Mode native base integer ISA supported by this RISC-V
Hart
| 3Ch| 0000Ah| User Mode native base integer ISA width (U-XLEN)| BYTE| ENUM| The
width (See below) of the User Mode native base integer ISA supported by this RISC-V Hart
